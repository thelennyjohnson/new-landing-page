          <p>Verification process</p>
          <p>
            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
            determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
            in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
            provide information so that we can match it with the information you
            have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
            request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
            that we can match the information you provide with the information
            we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
            communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously
            provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the
            circumstances dictate.

          <p>
            We will only use personal information provided in your request to

            possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you
            for the purposes of verification. If, however, if we cannot verify
            your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
            request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
            verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention
            purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as
            soon as we finish verifying you.
